# Instructions

Run `server.Test` to spawn a server that hosts a game, with one room that accepts six robots.

Start up six `example.CircleBot`s, and the game will start after the sixth `CircleBot` is started.

To show another display, run `client.Display` and give the room id (in this case `0`) as an argument.
